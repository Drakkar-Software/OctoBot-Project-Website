  optimisation_desc_html: |
    <p>OctoBot is designed to be very fast and scalable while letting extension development easily
    accessible for unexperienced developers. To achieve this, OctoBot is developed in
    <a href="https://www.python.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python</a> following an
    asynchronous architecture using
    <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asyncio</a>
    which enables CPU time optimization.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, computation and memory intensive processes are
    executed using your system's optimal native code thanks to
    <a href="https://cython.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cython</a>. With this architecture, OctoBot
    is able to work at 100% capacity in minimal environments such as on a
    <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raspberry Pi</a>.</p>

  story:
    the_obsticle: |
      <p>OctoBot is built for people who don't have much time or do not easily trust the crypto-world projects.
      Many trading automation tools exist but most of them are complicated to use, expensive, do not
      behave as intended or are meant to be used by profesional traders.</p>
      <p>Moreover, when a favorable trend
      is spotted, it can be difficult to maximise profit from it: trading takes a lot of time and when it's
      done automatically how to be sure that the robot will do what it is supposed to ?</p>
    the_challenge: |
      <p>Which value has an investment or a trade if it prevents you from sleeping because you are afraid
      of a potential bad decision ?</p>
      <p>How to be sure the robot will behave as expected ? OctoBot's philosophy
      is to be as transparent and reliable as possible.</p>
    the_challenge_li_1: the code is open source in order to be able to verify what the robot is doing
    the_challenge_li_2: |
      strategies are testable on past and real time data to ensure their
      reliability
    the_transformation: |
      <p>By using OctoBot, you will be able to automate your trades with the strategy you have chosen
      and the markets you want. Whether you are a beginner or an expert trader, each strategy
      is testable easily without any limit.</p>
      <p>You can use an existing setup or try and customize
      your own until you identify the perfect settings for your trading goals and proceed with
      real money trading and make real gains. With OctoBot, you use a robot that is verifiable
      and can be improved at any moment since it is open source and is now tested for many years.
      The OctoBot project was started in 2018.</p>

    octobot_creation:
      a_small_open_source_project: A small open source project
      birth_1: |
        February 2018, the cryptocurrency bubble just popped, a large
        correction as started. Guillaume and Herklos (OctoBot's founders)
        realise that pure technical analysis based trading starts to work
        well again.
      birth_2: |
        After searching for a tool able automate and optimize their trades,
        they realise that no open source robot allows to easily achieve this
        task. Herklos and Guillaume decide to develop a robot that
        will be optimized for technical analysis based strategies and easy to use.
      community_birth: Birth of the OctoBot community
      first_versions_p1: |
        Thanks to its
        <a href="https://github.com/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        presence on github.com</a>, OctoBot starts to grab users' attention.
        Slowly but steadily, the OctoBot user base grows and in early 2019, the
        OctoBot community was born. With time (and no communication except for the
        github.com repository), the community continue to get larger and larger.
      first_versions_p2: |
        In 2020, there was in average more than 100 simultaneous active users
        at all time. At the same time, the OctoBot project reaches a point from which
        the next step can start.
      ecosystem_launch: Launch of the ecosystem
      ecosystem: |
        After two years of user feedbacks, OctoBot is now stable and reliable enough
        for the project to scale. 2021 is the year the OctoBot ecosystem launches:
      ecosystem_item_1: OctoBot, the free open source robot that trades for its users
      ecosystem_item_2: |
        The OctoBot Marketplace which allows OctoBot users to try and share
        strategies and extensions
      ecosystem_item_3: The OctoBot community usage data which enables users to learn from one to another
    the_guide: |
      With OctoBot, you can simply test and use the strategies
      that fit you. OctoBot enables you to easily experiment strategies on

      experiment with OctoBot and customize it at as you wish.
    the_new_world: |
      Our goal is to enable users to focus on what matters to them, whether it
      is to explore the crypto world to find hidden gems or to optimize their
      trading strategies. OctoBot manages their trading portfolio according to
      the strategy they selected and tested before using their real money.
      Gains and risks are handled by a realiable and transparent tool that is
      always available and by their side.
  the_octobot_team: The OctoBot team
  octobot_core_team_desc: |
    Since 2018, OctoBot is developed without funding by Herklos
    and Guillaume: two passionate about the crypto world. Both have
    a developer background that allowed them to create OctoBot and the
    elements of the ecosystem based on their ideas and strong user feedbacks.
    All this time allowed to develop a very strong code base while in
    the mean time being able to focus of user need and make OctoBot
    evolve in the right direction.
  octobot_community_team_desc: |
    <p>The OctoBot team is also made of the community of its users,
    some of them are part of the community for years now.
    It is thanks to this community that OctoBot keeps evolving to answer
    best the users' needs and is growing towards the most useful features.</p>
    <p>Finally, this community is also about all the support brought to
    its new members using the
