        realise that pure technical analysis based trading starts to work
        well again.
      birth_2: |
        After searching for a tool able automate and optimize their trades,
        they realise that no open source robot allows to easily achieve this
        task. Herklos and Guillaume decide to develop a robot that
        will be optimized for technical analysis based strategies and easy to use.

        In 2020, there was in average more than 100 simultaneous active users
